# ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning
In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

Since we're trying to predict a number, this kind of problem is known as a regression problem.

The data and evaluation metric we'll be using **(root mean square log error or RMSLE)** is from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition.

### 1. Problem Definition
For this dataset, the problem we're trying to solve, or better, the question we're trying to answer is,

How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

### 2. Data
Looking at the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data), you can you it's a time series problem. This means there's a time attribute to dataset.

In this case, it's historical sales data of bulldozers. Including things like, model type, size, sale date and more.

There are 3 datasets:

Train.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples up to 2011 (close to 400,000 examples with 50+ different attributes, including SalePrice which is the target variable).
Valid.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples from January 1 2012 to April 30 2012 (close to 12,000 examples with the same attributes as Train.csv).
Test.csv - Historical bulldozer sales examples from May 1 2012 to November 2012 (close to 12,000 examples but missing the SalePrice attribute, as this is what we'll be trying to predict).

### 3. Evaluation
For this problem, Kaggle has set the evaluation metric to being **root mean squared log error (RMSLE)**. As with many regression evaluations, the goal will be to get this value as low as possible.

### 4. Modeling
After cleaning and imputing all missing values, our hypertuned **RandomForestRegressor** performs well with **RMSLE of 0.2511**.
