# Predicting heart disease using machine learning
This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model. capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

### 1. Problem Definition
In a statement,
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

### 2. Data
The original data came from the Cleavland data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)

There is also a version of it available on [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

### 3. Evaluation
If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

### 4. Modeling
After trying and hypertuning various classification models, **LogisticClassification** performs well with **accuracy of 84.46%** on cross-validation.
